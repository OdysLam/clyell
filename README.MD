Repository to run `jekyll build` and build the blog part of my website. 

The website is hosted on a [balena](https://balena.io) powered Raspberry pi 4, thus when I build the blog, I push to github and then connect to the server to fetch the new version.

The actual website's source files are hosted on [odyslam.github.io Repository](https://github/odyslam/odyslam.github.io) 

The website used to be hosted on Github Pages, thus the Repository's name.
